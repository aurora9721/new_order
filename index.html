      <p><em>Yoga</em></p>

I’ve spent a few days there during a journey through Israel and met this guy who lived there in a tent, just <i>trying to come back to himself</i>. Though that’s a good place to do that and came back a little bit to myself after a major breakup.</p>

      <p><em>Doric, Ionic, Corinthian (greek column styles)</em></p>
      <p>Three different subsequent architectural orders that defined the stylistic shape of the columns. The focus is on the capital: it starts with a very simple lined capital going to a duble volute/spiral capital, and ending with a nicely detailed leafed one.</p>

      <p><em>Final Judgement (Hans Memling)</em></p>
      <p>Absolutely overwhelming work, a gem in the crown of my area's local art museum in Gdańsk. So full of colors, of meaning, symbolism. In the museum you could go around it to see its sponsors painted on the back. <i>The Final Judgement</i> had a whole room devoted to it, so the work fully consumed you. I always somehow connected it to <i>Last Supper</i> by DaVinci. <i>Last Supper</i> was hanging in our church (lame) (and of course a reproduction only, which I for long did not know) and Memling had a room in a museum, ha! Where you at, Leonardo?</p>

      <p><em>Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno</em></p>
      <p>Last summer I was in Italy and went to Genova, a beautiful city structured like a maze. In this city lays the most impressive graveyard I have ever seen in my life. There was a village of little houses that the familie had build for there deceased family member. There were corridors with massive statues that representated the life of that deceased person.</p>

      <p><em>Pedro Salinas</em></p>
      <p>Spanish poet, member of the avantgarde Generation of ‘27. Poetic style is direct, simple, metaphorical and concise, and yet can convey multiple meanings at once. Genius in his humility. I often aim to have such a strong and poetic voice in my own work.</p>

      <p><em>Jazz</em></p>
      <p>The first kind of music that I genuinely liked, not because it was cool or familiar from the radio, but because I was fascinated by the sounds of the saxophone. For some reason, I always feel very luxurious when I listen to it, like being in a New York bar somewhere in the 1920s.</p>

      <p><em>The Cube personality test by Sigmunt Freud</em></p>
      <p>For some time I was really into analyzing people around me, how do they live, how did they grow up, what is important for them, what is their mindset. Its a test where you are asked to imagine yourself walking through the desert, and you encounter a cube. I gave this test over 60 people, I really learned about the imagination and connection to specific moments. This test is always time-related, it introduces the stranger to you the best, their inner self.</p>

      <p><em>Master and Margarite</em></p>
      <p>My favorite book as a child. Written by Michail Bulgakov. Depicts the game of the devil who came to visit Moscow. One of the main characters is <i>Begemot</i> – the huge black cat of the devil that can play chess and ride the tram.</p>

      <p><em>Thierry Mugler</em></p>
      <p>Thierry Mugler is a fashion designer that makes futuristic clothes for woman. In my opinion, he is a visionary. He works with the shape of a woman’s body and makes them through his clothes even more powerful.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_15">
      <p><em>Blue</em></p>
      <p>First time I saw the big blue painting in Stedelijk, the one by Barnett Newman. I just remember the feeling of being amazed by the number of colors and shades I saw. One of the most memorable but still new experiences with modern art. For me, it was the most complex simplicity. (the painting title is <i>Cathedra</i>)</p>

    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_17">
      <p><em>H. E. O. (Zbigniew Herbert)</em></p>
      <p>Short reinterpretation of a mythological story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Herbert reverses the usual narrative exposing Oprheus’ egotism and showing Eurydice’s new perspective. This poem opened my eyes to poetry and the fragment about the <i>eye of the volcano</i> was transcendental.</p>
      <br></div>
    <div class="entries2" id="entries2_18">
      <p><em>La Dolce Vita</em></p>
      <p>One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The combination of absurdity and beautiful imagery, humor and interesting narrative kept me mesmerized. </p>

      <p><em>Family</em></p>

    <p>Religious art is charged with symbolism, as it is meant to educate and indoctrinate. There is even meaning in its physical composition as a triptych; the holy trinity, the number 3. But the symbolisim of this number goes beyond Christianity:
      The <b>Three Hares</b> is a circular motif appearing in sacred sites from the Middle and Far East to the churches of Devon, England (as the <b>Tinners' Rabbits</b>), and historical synagogues in Europe. It is thought to have a range of symbolic or mystical associations with fertility and the lunar cycle.
